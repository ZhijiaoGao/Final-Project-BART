# Final-Project-BART
Programming Course Final Project - BART
This repository contains a Python version of the **Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)** using **PsychoPy**.
The task is designed to measure risk-taking behavior by having participants to pump a balloon (to earn rewards) or to cash out, with each pump increasing the risk of balloon explosion.


------

## Experiment Overview

- For each trial, participants pump the balloon by pressing **SPACE**
- Each pump increases: 1) The balloon size 2) The potential reward 3) The risk of explosion
- For each trial, participants can press **C** to cash out at any time
- If the balloon explodes, participants earn **nothing** for that trial
- Total earnings accumulate across 30 trials

The flow of the experiment is:
1) Instruction screens
2) An attention check
3) One practice trial
4) 30 actual trials
5) Trial-by-trial feedback
6) Data saved in .csv and exit
